# JSHeroes React Native Community

## Mission Statement
Welcome to the React Native Community Repo of JSHeroes! Our goal is to provide a *knowledge sharing hub*, where anyone interested in react-native can post issues and create pull requests. We started with a couple of [docs](./docs) which we want to expand upon so they can become valueable resources. We will also have *regular meetups* related to react-native, focusing on presentations as well as workshops as part of the [JSHeroes meetups](https://www.meetup.com/jsheroes/) group.

## Docs
* [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md)
* [Learning Resources](./docs/learning-resources.md)
* [Library Recomandations](./docs/library-recs.md)

## Meetups
* [React-Native Open Discussion](https://github.com/jsheroes/meetups/blob/master/frameworks/react/react-native-open-discussion.md)
* [Intro to React-Native and Apollo-Client](https://github.com/jsheroes/meetups/blob/master/frameworks/react/intro-react-native-graphql-apollo-client.md)
